This applicaiton was created as a part of our final project for CS2450. The app is a traditional card matching game where we are given a grid of several different cards. 
You flip one card at a time trying to get matching pairs until all cards are successfully matched. If the cards are a match gain 2 points, however if the next cards you chose
don't match 1 point will be deducted. You can not have negative points. Towards the end of the game, your score is recorded and you are able to save your score on a local database
within the game. The theme of our app is based off a small indie game called “Valorant”. To desgin the prototype we used Figma to implement the Golden Rules of UI including, 
but not limited to, strive for consistency, offer informativce feedback, reversal of actions and dialog to yieldd closure.
